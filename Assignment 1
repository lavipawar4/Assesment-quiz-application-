Assignment 1: Quiz App - Data Saved in Program Memory

This version stores the quiz questions and answers directly in the program's memory as a dictionary.

def quiz_memory():
    # Data stored in memory
    questions = {
        "What is the capital of France?": "Paris",
        "What is 2 + 2?": "4",
        "Who wrote 'Hamlet'?": "Shakespeare"
    }

    score = 0
    for question, answer in questions.items():
        user_answer = input(question + " ")
        if user_answer.strip().lower() == answer.lower():
            print("Correct!")
            score += 1
        else:
            print(f"Wrong! The correct answer is {answer}.")
    print(f"Your final score is: {score}/{len(questions)}")
